# STT_vosk_speech_transcript
This is my program based on vosk library to turn speech recordings to textfiles.
It works with Python 3 on Windows x86 x64 platforms
To use program you need to install:
- colorama (you can turn it off if you don't need colors in console)
- pydub
- easygui
- vosk (to run it you need to add speech recognition model to project, you can find it on vosk website)
- ffmpeg (can not do it with pip, visit official website)
